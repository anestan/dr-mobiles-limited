The Themosis framework is a WordPress focused framework. It helps you develop enterprise level WordPress applications and websites using an elegant and simple code syntax.

Getting started
---------------

### Prerequisites

In order to start a new installation of the Themosis framework, you need to have all [WordPress requirements](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed on your computer.

> We recommend to install Composer globally on your computer.

### Installing

Once you have Composer setup, run the following command in your Terminal or Console in order to install a fresh copy of the Themosis framework:

```bash
composer create-project themosis/themosis myproject
```

The above command will install a new instance of the Themosis framework under the `myproject` directory.
