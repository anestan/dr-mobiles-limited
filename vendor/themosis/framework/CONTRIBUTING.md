Contributing to Themosis
========================

As an open source project, Themosis welcomes contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

* Code patches
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and patch reviews

Extensive contribution guidelines are available online at:

- https://framework.themosis.com/docs/1.3/contributing/

**Warning: non-trivial pull requests (anything more than fixing a typo) without
opened issue will be closed!** `Please open and fill in an issue` to suggest changes.

- https://github.com/themosis/framework/issues

The Themosis framework uses Github issues to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and associated patches.

Patches must be submitted as pull requests against the `master` branch, but if you don't open an issue first to discuss it, it's unlikely that we'll notice your contribution.

Code of Conduct
===============

As a contributor, you can help us keep the Themosis community open and inclusive.
